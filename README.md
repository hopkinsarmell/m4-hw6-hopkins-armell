## Issues
1. I struggled with grasping the concept in the beginning. After our second lecture, I began to become more familiarized with how to start working on the material. I was able to review the videos to get further in the assignment; however, I ran into an issue with the toppings portion. Upon visiting the office hours on Sunday, things became significantly more clear being able to get one-on-one help in a guided learning manner. That was really helpful to me.

## Resources
1. No outside resources were used.
